# Single-Cell-RNA-Seq-Analysis-GSE111429

I have replicated the results of a paper studying single cell RNA-seq data of the prostatic epithelium. Using the R package, Seurat, I was able to analyse the cellular structure of the single cell RNA-seq data. For the analysis, please view the GSE111429 html file.
